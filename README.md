# 🎂 Birthday Card Project

This is a simple **Birthday Card Website** built with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The project demonstrates the use of:

- ✅ Basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, links, sections)  
- ✅ CSS styling (colors, backgrounds, border-radius, shadows)  
- ✅ Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) to add emojis around the heading  
- ✅ Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:target`) for animations and interactions  
- ✅ Responsive design concepts (centered card, scaling hover effects)
